## Ruby On Rails

##### Why use it

Ruby on Rails (ROL) is a web app development framework written in Ruby. It is opinionated on best practices for development so get on board if you're using this.

[ROL philosophy](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

> **Don't Repeat Yourself**: DRY is a principle of software development which states that
> *"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."* 
> By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.
>
> **Convention Over Configuration**: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults 
> to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify minutiae through endless configuration files.
